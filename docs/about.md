Breach Freeze is a 100% open source Password Checker alternative created and maintained by a one man developement team. I created the project after reading about Google's Password Checker extension, I know that many people would not like their information going through Google but would love to have the features of the extension

### About Me

I am a teenager who likes to develop and code in his free time. I do my best to maintain the list of databases and commenting the code to make it as easy to understand as I believe that even the average user should know exactly what their code is doing.
