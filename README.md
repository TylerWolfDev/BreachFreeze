# Breach Freeze
Be alerted to breaches, an open-source alternative to Google's password checker. Breach Freeze allows the user to get alerted when they attempt to sign into a service with a breached password. New breaches are added daily by the Breach Freeze team.

# The Story
I am Tyler Wolf, a young developer with a passion for security and open source projects. I aswell as many others read about Google's Password Checker extension for Chromium based browsers. The idea is excellent, but we may not want Big Tech to see all of the sensitive data that we enter on every web page. I decided to work a 100% open source alternative. I hope to get the extension on the Chrome Web Store as well as on the Brave Extensions store and a download link on my site. I will also provide a link on how to build the extension from the source yourself.

More Information Coming Soon.
